#Validated

Validated is a Î¼-library (~50 Source Lines of Code) that allows you make better use of Swift's type system by providing tools for easily generating new types with built-in guarantees.

Validated allows you to use the type system to verify properties of your values, providing a new level of compile time guarantees.

Using validators you can define new types that add guarantees to existing types:

```swift
// Create a new string type that can never be empty
typealias NonEmptyString = Validated<String, NonEmptyStringValidator>
```

##Example

You might have a function in your code that only knows how to work with a `User` value when the user is logged in. Usually you will implement this requirement in code & add documentation, but you don't have an easy way of expressing this invariant in the type signature:

```swift
/// Please ever only call with a logged-in user!
func performTaskWithUser(user: User) {
    precondition(
    	user.loggedIn, 
    	"It is illegal to call this method with a logged out user!"
    )

	// ...
}
```

Using Validated you can quickly create a new type that describes this requirement in the type system. That makes it impossible to call the function with a logged-out user and it makes the method signature express your invariant (instead of relying on documentation):

```swift
func performTaskWithUser(user: LoggedInUser) {
	// ...
}
```

**So how is this new `LoggedInUser` type created?**

First, you need to implement a validator:

```swift
struct LoggedInValidator: Validator {

    static func validate(value: User) -> Bool {
        return value.loggedIn
    }

}
```
A `Validator` needs to implement the `validate` function that takes the type that this validator can validate (in this case a `User`). The funtion returns a `Bool`. Return `true` if the requirements are fulfilled and `false` if not.

With the `Validator` in place we can create our new type like this:

```swift
typealias LoggedInUser = Validated<User, LoggedInValidator>
```

Note, that it is not required to provide a typealias, but for most cases it is recommended.

**And that's it!**

`LoggedInUser` now has a failable initializer that takes a `User`. If the passed in `User` fulfills the logged-in requirement you will have a `LoggedInUser`, otherwise `nil`.

The underlying value (the full `User` value) is stored in the `.value` property of `LoggedInUser`.

##Beyond the Basics

Validated provides two further features that might be non-obvious.

###Validated2, Validated3

Using `Validated2` or `Validated3` you can create a new type that has two or three requirements, respectively. All requirements need to be verified successfully in order for the type to initialize:

```swift
typealias AllCapsNonEmptyString =
            Validated2<String, NonEmptyStringValidator, AllCapsLatinStringValidator>
```

###Generic Validators

A `Validator` can itself be generic. This is useful if you want to provide verifications for a whole category of types. The example validator `NonEmptyCollectionValidator` can be applied to all validator types by using a generic requirement:

```swift
struct NonEmptyCollectionValidator<T: CollectionType>: Validator {
    static func validate(value: T) -> Bool {
        if !value.isEmpty {
            return true
        } else {
            return false
        }
    }
}
```
However, when using this validator to create a type, you will have to specify the exact type of collection you want to validate:

```swift
typealias NonEmptyListOfStrings = Validated<[String], NonEmptyCollectionValidator<[String]>>
```
